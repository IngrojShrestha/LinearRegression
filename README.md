# Linear Regression

## Training Dataset

house-price.csv contains a series of data points. Each data point is comma-seperated, reresenting price and area (derived from https://s3.amazonaws.com/back-end-training/house-prices.csv).

The first column is the label.

## Implementing linear regression

```bash
$ python3 linear_regression.py house-price.csv test_data.csv
```
